## ➤ INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

```
To debug Python code with the help of artificial intelligence, you can follow these general steps:

- Installing Python: Make sure that Python is correctly installed on your system. If you are using Windows, download and install the latest version of Python from the official website and check the “Add Python to PATH” option during installation.

- On Linux, you can install it via your distribution's package manager, for example with sudo apt install poetry for Ubuntu/Debian.

- Using an IDE with AI support: Choose an integrated development environment (IDE) that offers debugging features and AI support. For example, Visual Studio Code and PyCharm are two popular IDEs that offer extensions and tools for debugging and integrating with AI services.

- IDE Configuration: Configure your IDE for debugging. In Visual Studio Code, for example, you can install the Python extension created by Microsoft, which includes a debugger and other useful tools. Then select the appropriate Python interpreter in your IDE.

- Using debugging modules: Use debugging modules like pdb for Python, which allow you to set breakpoints, step through the code, inspect variables, etc.

- Integration with AI services: For additional help, you can integrate AI services like OpenAI into your Python application. This will allow you to ask questions and get answers from the AI to solve code problems.
